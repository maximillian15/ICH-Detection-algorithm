##CranioScan: A CNN-Transformer Model for Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection

CranioScan is a deep learning system designed to automatically detect six types of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) from CT imaging.
It uses a hybrid architecture combining ResNet50 (CNN feature extractor) with a Transformer encoder, enabling both local and global feature understanding.
This project is built in TensorFlow and supports DICOM image loading

1. Project Overview
Bleeding inside the skull is a crucial and potentially lethal neurological event known as an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
Intracranial hemorrhage requires immediate diagnosis, but interpretation of CT scans is time-critical and requires high expertise.

CranioScan aims to:
  1.Improve detection speed
  2.Assist radiologists with AI-powered classification
  3.Explore modern hybrid deep learning architectures for medical imaging
